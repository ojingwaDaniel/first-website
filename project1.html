    <h1>EXPERIENCE ON MY FIRST WEBSITE</h1>
    <h2>My begining of web development</h2>
    <!--paragrah stands with p -->
    <p>
      Actually all i wanted to do to just focus on python but i realised
      that gaining knowledge at both end gives you more advantage and moreover 
      i was pushed after most of my collegues had a knowledge of it.  i have a little knowledge of it but am open to improving .
      <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">   Social media has been a big distraction on my programming career </b>, but i have come up with the idea of studying for an hour and have a 15mins break and resume after, with that i end up studying more than trying to studying 5 hours straight and end up breaking down along the road out of fatigue and laziness.
